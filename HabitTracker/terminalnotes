notes on new commands in terminal I learned for python/django


python3 -m venv myvenv

source myvenv/bin/activate

sudo easy_install pipsource myvenv/bin/activate

sudo pip install virtualenv

python -m pip install Django

python3 manage.py runserver

python -m pip install --upgrade pip


notes that some pip commands depreciated so I looked up other ways
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

running files to start above since easy_install doesn't work anymore
python get-pip.py
